# Air-quality-Prediction-Challenge
This clear the concept of multivariate regression in machine learning. Air Quality data set is used in this project for prediction. Accuracy on test dataset got is 96% which is very good.
Code is from scratch. Recommend to go through the Andrew NG course coursera for the brief knowledge of the gradient decent and convergance.
